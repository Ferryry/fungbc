## FunGBC
Gameboy emulator implemented in F*#*/.net

This project is primarily an excuse for me to be coding F# and learning how to write emulators.

The aim is to provide an understandable and well written source code for the Gameboy platform. Stability & clarity is more important than performance. 

The source code tries to emphasize functional programming concepts, however due to the heavy mutating nature of emulators and to achieve acceptable performance quite a bit of state mutation is needed.

#### Status

The emulator can run most Gameboy games with varying success. 

A fairly powerful computer is needed to achieve full fps.

#### Building

###### Windows
Build fungbc.sln with Visual Studio, xbuild or Xamarin Studio
